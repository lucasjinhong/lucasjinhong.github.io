My name is **Koh Jin Hong, Lucas**. I am a highly motivated Electronic Engineering Master's candidate at the National Taipei University of Technology, expecting to graduate in August 2025. My academic and practical experiences have equipped me with a robust foundation in networking protocols (TCP/IP, 5G, IAB), programming (Python, C++, JavaScript/Node.js), and system development.

I am passionate about tackling complex technical challenges and developing innovative solutions. My work includes research on distributed link scheduling for IAB Networks, automation of firmware testing using Docker and Jenkins, and development of backend systems with Node.js, AWS, and MongoDB.
